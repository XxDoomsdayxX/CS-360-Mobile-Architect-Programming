For this project, I developed an inventory management app designed to help users efficiently manage their inventory, track stock levels, and receive notifications for low stock or product expiration. The main goal of the app was to provide a simple, easy-to-use solution for managing inventory, while also incorporating user-centered design principles to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience. The app addresses the need for better organization and the ability to receive timely alerts about inventory levels, preventing stock shortages or expired products.

To support these user needs, the app includes several key screens: a home screen for viewing and managing inventory, an item detail screen for adding and editing items, and a settings screen for customizing notifications. The UI design was kept clean and simple, with clear navigation to minimize user frustration. I ensured that the app was intuitive by placing essential actions, like adding and editing items, within easy reach. The use of text fields for input, buttons for actions, and an organized layout for displaying inventory helped users quickly find what they needed without feeling overwhelmed.

When coding the app, I took an organized approach. I started by outlining the core functionality, such as the ability to add, update, and delete inventory items, as well as manage user preferences for notifications. I broke down the tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and tackled them one by one, ensuring the core features were functional before adding enhancements. I used strategies like building an MVP first and iterating on it, which helped me focus on the essential features and refine the app as I went along. In the future, I plan to apply these strategies to other projects by always focusing on building a solid core first and then enhancing it.

To test the app, I performed manual testing by interacting with the app on different devices and scenarios to check if all features worked as expected. I also used unit tests for individual components to ensure everything was functioning correctly. Testing is crucial because it helps identify and fix bugs early, ensuring the app works smoothly and meets user expectations. Through testing, I found a few issues with input validation and UI responsiveness that I was able to fix before the app was finalized.

Throughout the development process, I had to innovate when figuring out how to handle notifications for low stock and expiration. Initially, I had issues with triggering notifications at the right times, but by adjusting the way I handled database updates and checking for user preferences, I was able to get the notification system working properly. This was a challenge that required me to think creatively and explore new approaches.

One area where I was particularly successful was in designing and implementing the user interface. I was able to create a UI that was both functional and intuitive, ensuring that users could easily navigate the app and complete tasks without confusion. By focusing on clarity and simplicity, I was able to demonstrate my ability to apply user-centered design principles effectively.
